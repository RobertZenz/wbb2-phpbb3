WBB2-PHPBB3
-----------

A convert for WoltLab Burning Board 2 to PHPBB3.


Dependencies
------------

 * PHP 5.3
   * PDO
 * [PHPBB STK (Support Toolkit)](https://www.phpbb.com/customise/db/official_tool/stk/)


Usage
-----

Just copy everything onto your server, edit the file `DatabaseFactory.php` to
match your settings and run the scripts in in the following order:

 * forums.php
 * topics.php
 * posts.php
 * messages.php
 * users.php
 * statistics.php

Now got to the STK and run the following jobs:

 * Support Tools -> Orphaned Posts (check if everything imported correctly)
 * Support Tools -> Fix Left/Right IDs (just to be sure)
 * Support Tools -> Reclean usernames
 * Admin Tools -> Reparse BBCodes (check the box to reparse everything)

This should have done the trick.


Downsides:
---------

 * All users will lose profile information
 * No avatars
 * All users need to reset their passwords
 * No import of (any) permissions
